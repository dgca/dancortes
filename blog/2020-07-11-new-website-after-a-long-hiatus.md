title: New website after a long hiatus!
excerpt: It's been a while, y'all. In this post, I'll talk about my new site, and what I plan on talking about in the future.

Holy moly, it's been 4 years since I wrote my last blog post. In short, I didn't love my previous site and it made it hard to work up the motivation to put work into it. I kept telling myself I'd start writing again once I made a new website, and 4 years later, here we are.

A lot has changed for me since I last wrote anything. The biggest change is probably that I'm now the front-end lead at [Albert.io](https://www.albert.io/). I also got a hamster named Phoebe. She is an angel.

On the tech side, I've been working with React for 5 years now, and have a ton of stuff I'd love to write about React and the ecosystem. I've also picked up a lot of general knowledge about front-end dev, vanilla JS, Node, and more. All things that I'm very excited to write about.

I've also put together some talks for Meetups here in Chicago, and I'm planning on recording them and putting them online as well.

I'm pretty happy with this new website and how easy it is to get new posts up, so hopefully that will encourage me to post more often.

If you're curious, this site is:

- Built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework
- Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Styled using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- Blog posts are just Markdown files rendered using [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and [react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)
- Contact form is using [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/)

All the stuff above means it's hosted and maintained for free, so I'm super greatful to the folks behind those tools and services.

That's all I have for now, expect some more technical posts soon!
