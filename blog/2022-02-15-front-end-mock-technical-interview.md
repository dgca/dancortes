I ran a mock front-end interview on my friend and former coworker DonTheDeveloper's channel, and I've gotten a lot of messages from folks saying that it was really helpful. I figured I'd share it here in case it can help other people. We go through some vanilla JS questions, and put together a little React project.

Huge shoutout to Noa for doing this, and to Don for setting it up.

Best of luck out there, y'all!

❤️ Dan
